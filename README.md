This is a Tezos sample dapp under active development to showcase best practices for building a dApp. The sample dApp uses beacon, taquito, ligo and tzkt to view, deploy and interact onchain. Goal is to enable Tezos interested developers to bootstrap a dApp within 30 minutes.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
